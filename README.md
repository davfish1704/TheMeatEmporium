# The Meat Emporium

Static, framework-free website for The Meat Emporium. Open `site/index.html` (or individual pages) directly in a browser or host on any static provider such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Pages
- `site/index.html` – simple landing linking to both experiences.
- `site/butcher.html` – butcher shop ordering via WhatsApp.
- `site/steakhouse.html` – steakhouse menu with WhatsApp reservations.

All styling lives in `site/assets/css/style.css` and shared behavior in `site/assets/js/app.js`. Update the WhatsApp number once in `app.js` to change every CTA.
